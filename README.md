### Data Source
The data used for this analysis is obtained from FAOSTAT, focusing on edible offal from cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs, spanning the years 2011-2021 and encompassing various countries.

Dataset: [Cleaned FAOSTAT Livestock Data.csv](https://github.com/akhila006-code/Tableau-Visualizations/blob/main/Cleaned%20FAOSTAT%20Livestock%20Data.csv)


### Data Cleaning
•	Data Loading and Inspection

•	Handling Missing Values

•	Data Standardization & Handling Outliers


### Key Visualizations:
•	Line Graphs: Displaying the worldwide production of major edible offal, including trends in the percentage of total value and absolute value over time.

•	Bar Graphs: Highlighting the production value of edible offal items by geographical area and year.

•	Box and Whisker Plot: Illustrating the annual production value distribution of edible offal items from 2011 to 2021.

•	Map Visualization: Showing the proportion of producing animals, specifically edible offal of cattle, categorized by fresh, chilled, or frozen status.

•	Correlation Graph: Analyzing the relationships between different types of meat production.

### Impact:
The interactive dashboard offers stakeholders crucial insights into global production trends and regional differences in edible offal products, supporting more informed decision-making. By presenting data intuitively, it enhances understanding of market dynamics and production patterns, aiding strategic planning, resource allocation, and identifying growth opportunities in the agricultural sector. This improved data visibility helps optimize supply chain processes, better respond to market demands, and ultimately leads to more efficient and profitable operations.
